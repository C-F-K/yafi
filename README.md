Yet Another Fancy Interjector
*or,*
You Ash Fow It

Swear with five-dollar college words. 

Reads in lexicon files for each part of speech, and generatively builds a totally non-offensive but extremely venomous phrase.

Currently command-line only, but the main todo is to make it a(n easily distributable) desktop app.
